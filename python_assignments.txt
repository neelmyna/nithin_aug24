whatsApp Update:

1. Content of the day
2. Feedback
3. Assignments Done (Yes / No, with how many)
4. Queries/Others
EXAMPLE:
1. Content of the day
	Problem solving using Loops, Python List, List comprehension
2. Feedback
	The problem solving seamed to be challenging. The Trainer could have used the time more effectively in the sense that more problem could have been solved.
3. Assignments Done (Yes / No, with how many)
	5 coding assignments were gievn out of which 3 on Loops and 2 on Lists. All 5 problems I have solved and I have understood them and I have traced the logic with different set of I/P.
4. Queries/Others
	What are other IDEs we can use to code in Python? Will be learning OOP in this training?

day4 Assignments:
Problems:
1. User gives the data like this:
kerala-tiruvanantapuram karnataka-bengaluru tamilnadu-chennai
You have to separate the states and store in the list states[] and also the seperated capitals must be stored in capitals[]

2. Accpet a string of space seperated numbers and store them as a matrix (list of lists) of n rows.
Now print the matrix row-wise

3. Accept N strings and count the number of Palindromes in it.

4. Accept N strings, and check howmany of them possess the string X

5. Accept N main strings and N sub strings into lists and check create a list of numbers of 0s and 1s where 0 represents that the sub string at respective index is not a substring of the main string.
